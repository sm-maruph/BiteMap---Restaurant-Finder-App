# BiteMap---Restaurant-Finder-App
BiteMap is a web-based Restaurant Finder application built using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. This project was developed as part of my University course requirements for the Database Management Laboratory. The app allows users to search for restaurants, view their details, and explore dining options in their area.
